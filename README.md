## Reflection 

This project was built primarily while I was studying in the Nucamp Full Stack Web and Mobile Application Development Bootcamp, during the Bootstrap course. The project goals included using Bootstrap, SASS, and CSS in order to familiarize myself with these technologies. 

While implementing this project I ran into several challenges. To make the project more visually appealing a variety of CSS techniques were implemented, including the use of clip-path, hover effects, animations, and different layout styles. Many of these effects were made with the assistance of tutorials from w3schools.com.
